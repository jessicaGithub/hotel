# Webjet take home challenge
Create a single-page application using ReactJS to display a list of hotels according to the provided designs. 
The page should be fully responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile screens. 
By default, hotels should be listed by price in ascending order. 
Users should be able to filter hotels by name or star rating.

Demonstrate the following:
- Fully responsive page layout with breakpoints at 992px & 768px	  
- Valid & Semantic HTML markup
- Accuracy & Consistency (e.g. component sizes, colors, spacing)
- Reusable components
- Use GitHub repository to check-in small commits to show your progress
- Include a Readme file to document any assumption or choice of framework/library used

### Commands
Run locally: ```npm run dev```
Run tests: ```npm run test```
Build: ```npm run build```

## Assumptions made
- Since the application is small, I used the normal boilerplate of react + typescript + jest 
- Thought about using Tailwind but I haven't used it for a while so decided it'll be faster to use plain CSS for this test
- I'm assuming the font is Roboto, as per the main font of the current webjet site
